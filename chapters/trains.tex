\chapter{Application to railway dispatching and conflict management}

As a conclusion of the thesis, in this chapter we describe how the results presented so far can be applied in the field of operational research. Namely, we propose an approach to solving railway dispatching problem using quantum annealing. We benchmark implementation of our algorithm for simple problem instances on current generation of D-Wave annealers, using solutions obtained via tensor networks and exhaustive search as a baseline for comparison.


\section{Railway dispatching and conflict management}
In our work, we focused only on the delay management in single-track railways in the presence of railway traffic disturbance. Consider a part of
