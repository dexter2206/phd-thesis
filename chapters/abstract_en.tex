\chapter*{Abstract}

In this thesis, we focus on the problem of validating and benchmarking quantum annealers in a practical context. To this end, we propose two algorithms solving real--world problems and test how well they perform on the current generation of quantum annealers. The first algorithm allows for solving dynamics of arbitrary (complex or real) dynamical systems. The second of the proposed algorithms is suitable for solving a particular family of railway dispatching problems, delay and conflict management on single--track railway lines.
