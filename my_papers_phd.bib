abstract = {We introduce a new framework for implementing Binary Quadratic Model (BQM) solvers called Omnisolver. The framework provides an out-of-the-box dynamically built command-line interface as well as an input/output system, thus heavily reducing the effort required for implementing new algorithms for solving BQMs. The proposed software should be of benefit for researchers focusing on quantum annealers or discrete optimization algorithms as well as groups utilizing discrete optimization as a part of their daily work. We demonstrate the ease of use of the proposed software by presenting a step-by-step, concise implementation of an example plugin.}
